"""Poster reports: users flag a poster from the configurator's live preview and
the operator reviews them in the dashboard's Reports view.

Off unless the operator turns it on (REPORTS_ENABLED).  Abuse is handled per
reporting address:

  * REPORTS_PER_IP caps the reports one address may file in 24 hours;
  * REPORTS_PURGE_THRESHOLD: an address that sends more than this many
    within 7 days (refused ones included) has every unresolved report it
    filed deleted and is blocked from reporting until the operator unblocks
    it.

A report the operator resolves stops counting against both, so someone whose
reports keep turning out right isn't held back by limits meant for noise.
Dismissing or deleting one gives nothing back; reopening takes it back.

Both depend on seeing each user's own address.  Behind a reverse proxy that
means uvicorn has to trust the proxy's X-Forwarded-For (FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS);
without that every request comes from the proxy, everyone shares one limit
and one user's flood gets everyone's reports deleted.  forwarding_state()
detects that case, and reports are refused while it holds.

Addresses are never stored: a reporter is an HMAC of the address under a
per-instance secret, so the dashboard can group and block reporters without
the database holding anyone's IP.  IPv6 addresses are keyed by their /64,
which one household or server holds as a whole, so rotating within it
doesn't reset the limits.
